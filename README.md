## Getting Started
Mission Lab is a Kubernetes-based environment designed to support cloud, on-premises, and disconnected (air-gapped) deployments for mission-critical applications. It provides services such as multi-tenant storage via MinIO and ML/DL/AI capabilities through Tenjin and Koverse. The only supported method for deploying applications into Mission Lab is through Zarf packages and UDS bundles, which ensure secure, declarative, and portable software delivery. This document details the process of creating, building, validating, testing, and deploying mission-critical applications in Mission Lab, including requesting Pepr exceptions to bypass cluster policies, accessing company-specific registries for package and bundle storage, and utilizing GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automation.

Use the [getting started] guide to create and publish Zarf and or UDS Bundles to any air gapped environment.
